Directory for certs for ALB. Actual certs ignored by git.

Terraform doesn't yet support import of certs to amazon ACM, though
this feature is supposed to be coming soon in aws_acm_certificate.

To import via AWS CLI do this:
 aws acm import-certificate --certificate file://Certificate.pem
                           --certificate-chain file://CertificateChain.pem
                           --private-key file://PrivateKey.pem

To list certs (e.g. to get ARN):
 aws acm list-certificates
